gene: 16-bit number

1 bit for in type  (2 vals)
1 bit for out type (2 vals)
3 bits for in index (7 possible inputs)
3 bits for out index (7 possible outputs)
8 bits for strength (256 possible values [convert to double])
  - need to multiply 0.015625 by the value to get true strength value

reproduction:
split each genome in half (genome should always be even)
0.001 chance for mutation (or cross over)

brain:
  max 8 inputs -> max 4 inner -> max 8 outputs
  inputs:
    - crowded
    - close to left
    - close to right
    - close to top
    - close to bottom
    - [n/a]
    - [n/a]
    - [n/a]
  output:
    - move random
    - move left
    - move right
    - move up
    - move down
    - [n/a]
    - [n/a]
    - [n/a]
